                    <h2>About Me!</h2><span>
                        <span>Hello and welcome crystal family!! I am so excited you found my website! I am so excited
                            to get to know you and tell you about myself!.. My name is Angie, I have two boys and am
                            happily married. It took me many years to find this journey and I am beyond grateful I
                            did!
                            <hr>

                            Let me backup just a little bit. I remember my first crystal, it was Pyrite, my dad brought
                            it home and called it fools gold. I thought it was so neat, like real gold! My next crystal
                            I remember was Tigers eye. My dad had a ring, and I thought it was really cool. My innocence
                            and being a young child at the time, thought it was a real Tigers eye. Not much after that,
                            however I do remember older ladies, while up at my grandparents cabin wearing Turquoise
                            jewelry. I want to say my Aunt even had some. The memory is not clear. Anyway, the final
                            crystal I remember growing up was Amethyst. I do not have a clear story on that one, but I
                            do fondly remember it. As I grew older, I was never fond of crystals. Or should I say, they
                            just did not peak my interest. And when I think back to that, I believe it is because I did
                            not know the power, the energy, the history behind crystals or where they really came from.

                        <h2>Chaos</h2><span>
                            <span>I believe it was nine years ago where my journey began, and it did not start with
                                crystals.. It started with the Universe! I was going through one of the hardest times of
                                my life. I was heartbroken and lost. One thing that helped me escape my pain was
                                reading. I love reading, and read more than ever to rest my mind. One of the many books
                                I read was ‘The Secret’. That book changed my thinking, it helped me accept things I
                                could not accept in the past and it led me to change my life. Change me as a person. I
                                continued getting better, happier, meeting new people and making new friends. I met
                                people that wore crystals as jewelry, sold crystals, and used crystals in their daily
                                life. I bought some here and there, nothing big. I had a friend that started selling
                                crystals, so later I decided to buy from her, support her. I bought crystals that were
                                pretty to me. I started learning the names of the crystals and learned that they come
                                from the Universe.. Mother Earth, they are here for a reason and hold great energies for
                                many different things. I started to research and buy more crystals. I bought crystals
                                that I felt I needed, not because of their beauty. I bought crystals that were good for
                                sadness, anxiety, keeps away negativity, brings joy and happiness. I started a pretty
                                good collection.. I won’t lie, it got a little bit out of hand, but I was so drawn to
                                their energy!.. I can stand by my fireplace mantel where a good portion of my Spheres
                                are and feel the energy! It is such a neat feeling! I started to use my crystals for
                                manifesting and speaking to the Universe. I am now learning to ground myself and
                                meditate with crystals, and looking to learn more about our chakras. I decided to sell
                                crystals, because I want others to experience these energies. I want to share my
                                experience as to why I love crystals. I hope you find your peace regardless and all that
                                makes you happy, you have. Thank you for reading! I hope you have a beautiful
                                day!</span>
