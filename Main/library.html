<h1 class="headings">A little history about crystals</h1>
<div class="intro">
<p>
  You may think that crystals are a new age fad, but they are actually one of the oldest forms of healing and have always been used for protection.
  <br>
  <br>
Just something to think about, according to an ancient medical text, in Iraq 5,500 years ago Lapis Lazuli and Jasper were laid around a living person to cure their ills and Bloodstone was used for diseases of the blood, exactly as today.  
<br>
<br>
In Egypt in 1900 BCE, Lapis Lazuli, Jasper, Carnelian and Turquoise were placed around the necks of newborn babies to protect them. 
<br>
<br>
 I myself am still learning about how crystals were used many years ago, and find it fascinating how they are now coming about to this date!

  Listed below are some of many more crystals that I have for sale. If you would like more information please message me or follow me on Social Media.

      <h2>CLEANING AND CHARGING YOUR CRYSTALS</h2>
     
    </div>
  </div>

    <p class="intro">  Cleansing refers to clearing the crystal of any negative, stale energy and charging is replacing used up energy from continuous use of a crystal.
      <br>
      <br>
      There are several ways to cleanse our crystals. You choose what is best for you.  Personally, I like to use sage.  
     
      If you are going to use water or salt water, just make sure you are  not putting the wrong crystal in water.  Crystals that are not friable soluble, or layered can be held under running water or immersed in salt water.

Crystals need to be cleansed when you buy them and after wearing or using for healing.  
<br>
<br>
Always cleanse jewelry/crystals that come to you from someone else, as it can hold their negative vibrations and pass them on to you.
<br>
<br>
Citrine, Kyanite, and Azeztulite are self-cleaning.  Clear Quartz, Selenite (Satin Spar)  and Carnelian cleanse other crystals.  
<br>
<br>
When cleansing  your crystals, hold the intention that all negativity will be washed away and the crystal reenergized.  
I charge my crystals once a month, and this is really simple. Every full moon I set my crystals outside, or on my windowsill overnight.  
<br>
<br>
Do not forget to set your intentions.  
For example, If your purpose is self love, you will hold the crystal (Rose Quartz)  in your hand, imagine light surrounding it and say “I program this crystal to amplify self-love”
<br>
<br>

I definitely recommend The Crystal Bible book by Judy Hall. I have received a lot of my Crystal education from her three books.
