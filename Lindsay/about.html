                    <p class="lead">Let me first begin by telling you where I got the name Crystal Chaos.
                        When I first decided to sell crystals, I started with the name Crystal Clear. It
                        wasn’t enough for me. I
                        knew I needed a different name, something that spoke to me, something that has great
                        meaning to the name. I
                        had a beautiful black cat. He had the best personality, he was so cute and I had so
                        much love for this cat.
                        He made me smile, when I was away, I always looked forward to getting home to see
                        him. When I was on
                        vacation, I missed him! I tried to get my boys to facetime with me, so I could see
                        him. His presence made me
                        so happy. Chaos unexpectedly passed away on my birthday 12/27/21 I was devastated, I
                        went into a depression,
                        I never knew an animal could have such an effect on me. Chaos was my baby, he was
                        only
                        2 ½ years old. Chaos brought me so much joy, I still cry thinking of him, looking at
                        pictures or videos of
                        him. I will no longer celebrate my birthday, but I will instead celebrate him that
                        day each year. Changing
                        the name to Crystal Chaos, lets me continue to represent Chaos and hold him in
                        special memory.</p>

                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p class="lead">I believe it was nine years ago where my journey began, and it did not start
                        with
                        crystals. It started with
                        the Universe! I was going through one of the hardest times of my life. I was heartbroken
                        and
                        lost. One thing
                        that helped me escape my pain was reading. I love reading, and read more than ever to
                        rest
                        my
                        mind. One of
                        the many books I read was ‘The Secret’. That book changed my thinking, it helped me
                        accept
                        things I could
                        not accept in the past and it led me to change my life. Change me as a person. I
                        continued
                        getting better,
                        happier, meeting new people and making new friends. I met people that wore crystals as
                        jewelry,
                        sold
                        crystals, and used crystals in their daily life. I bought some here and there, nothing
                        big.
                        I
                        had a friend
                        that started selling crystals, so later I decided to buy from her, support her. I bought
                        crystals that were
                        pretty to me. I started learning the names of the crystals and learned that they come
                        from
                        the
                        Universe,
                        Mother Earth, they are here for a reason and hold great energies for many different
                        things.
                        I
                        started to
                        research and buy more crystals. I bought crystals that I felt I needed, not because of
                        their
                        beauty. I
                        bought crystals that were good for sadness, anxiety, keeps away negativity, brings joy
                        and
                        happiness. I
                        started a pretty good collection. I won’t lie, it got a little bit out of hand, but I
                        was so
                        drawn to their
                        energy!. I can stand by my fireplace mantel where a good portion of my Spheres are and
                        feel
                        the
                        energy! It
                        is such a neat feeling! I started to use my crystals for manifesting and speaking to the
                        Universe. I am now
                        learning to ground myself and meditate with crystals, and looking to learn more about
                        our
                        chakras. I decided
                        to sell crystals, because I want others to experience these energies. I want to share my
                        experience as to
                        why I love crystals. I hope you find your peace regardless and all that makes you happy,
                        you
                        have. Thank you
                        for reading! I hope you have a beautiful day!.</p>
